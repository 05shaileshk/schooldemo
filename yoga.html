                <p>Yoga is an ancient practice that began in the Indian subcontinent over 6,000 years ago. The word “Yoga” comes from the Sanskrit word “Yuj,” which means discipline and union. It was religiously practised by yogis, sadhus, and rishis. Originally, yoga was a spiritual practice aimed at achieving inner peace and better understanding oneself. Over time, it evolved to include various physical postures (called asanas), breathing exercises (known as pranayama), and meditation techniques. </p>
