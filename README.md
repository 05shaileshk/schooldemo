 school demo project in web development typically involves creating a website or web application that serves as a showcase of a student's skills and knowledge in building websites. Here's a brief summary of what such a project might include:
 HTML: To create the structure of each page.
 CSS: For styling the pages and ensuring they look professional and user-friendly
 You can use modern CSS features like Flexbox or Grid for layout, and media queries for responsiveness.
 Features and Layout:
 Responsive Design: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly by using media queries to adjust the layout depending on the screen size.
 Navigation: Implement a sticky navigation bar or hamburger menu for easy access across all pages.
Image Slideshow: Use JavaScript or CSS to create a carousel or slideshow for showcasing school images or events.
Hover Effects: Use CSS hover effects to add interactivity to buttons, links, and images for better user experience.
Form Validation: Implement simple JavaScript validation for the contact form (e.g., checking for empty fields, valid email).
Animations: Use CSS animations or JavaScript libraries like AOS (Animate on Scroll) to make sections of the page animate as the user scrolls.
 Layout Example:
Header: Contains the school logo, name, and a navigation menu (Home, About, Programs, Admissions, Contact).
Main Content: A large hero section with a welcoming message or a school image, followed by sections like About Us, Programs, etc.
Footer: Includes copyright information, quick links, and contact details.
Call-to-action (CTA): Buttons or links encouraging visitors to get in touch or apply.
